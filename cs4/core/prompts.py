CONSTRAINT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are a writing expert. I am going to give you a blog as an input. 
You can assume that a large language model (LLM) generated the blog.

Your task has two parts:
1. Identify the main task of the blog in one sentence. 
   - For example: "The main task is to write a blog about strategies for successful remote working."
   - Phrase the main task as an instruction.
2. Generate a set of 39 free-form constraints that you think might have been given to the LLM to generate the blog.
   - DO NOT REPEAT CONSTRAINTS.
   - Constraints must be atomic (a single indivisible condition). If a constraint can be broken into smaller constraints, do so.
   - Avoid proper nouns in your constraints.
   - Constraints should drive at least a few sentences in the blog (do not write constraints that map to only one line).
   - Constraints must strictly pertain to the content, ideas, arguments, or narrative direction of the blog and should influence how the blog develops.
   - If (and only if) you cannot write 39 atomic, content-based constraints, give stylistic constraints based on how the blog is written (tone, use of examples, formatting, etc.).
   - Write all constraints in the form of instructions. For example: "The blog should include practical tips."
   - CRITICAL RANDOMIZATION STEP: You must disrupt the chronological flow. To do this, strictly follow this pattern: Write your first constraint about the conclusion of the blog. Write your second constraint about the introduction. Write your third constraint about the middle. Continue jumping back and forth across the timeline of the narrative for all 39 constraints.

Here is a worked example to guide you:

Input Blog: 
Working from home has become the new normal for millions of professionals worldwide. While it offers flexibility and eliminates commutes, it also presents unique challenges that can impact both productivity and well-being.

To optimize your home workspace, start by creating a dedicated area free from distractions. This space should have good lighting, comfortable seating, and all necessary equipment within reach. Many experts recommend facing a window for natural light, which can boost mood and energy levels.

Establish clear boundaries between work and personal time. Set specific work hours and stick to them, just as you would in an office. Communicate these boundaries to family members or housemates to minimize interruptions during work hours.

Take regular breaks throughout the day. The Pomodoro Technique, which involves 25-minute focused work sessions followed by 5-minute breaks, can help maintain concentration and prevent burnout. Use break time to stretch, hydrate, or take a short walk.

Stay connected with colleagues through regular video calls and instant messaging. This helps maintain team cohesion and prevents feelings of isolation. Schedule virtual coffee breaks or team-building activities to foster relationships.

Finally, prioritize your physical and mental health. Maintain a regular exercise routine, eat nutritious meals, and get adequate sleep. Consider meditation or mindfulness practices to manage stress and maintain focus.

Output:
Main Task: Write a blog about strategies for successful remote working.

Constraints:
1. Require the setting of defined working hours.
2. Explain the risks of isolation if connection practices are neglected.
3. Warn about the risk of burnout without intentional self-care.
4. Explain how the removal of commuting affects time use and daily rhythm.
5. Suggest strategies for maintaining healthy eating while at home.
6. Emphasize reducing environmental distractions in that space.
7. Argue for the necessity of regular breaks during the workday.
8. Encourage informal online gatherings to maintain rapport.
9. Recommend mindfulness or meditation as stress-management tools.
10. Stress the value of adhering consistently to those hours.
11. Show how workspace ergonomics (chair, desk) influence long-term health.
12. Conclude with a call to action urging readers to adopt concrete changes immediately.
13. Link exercise directly to improved cognitive performance and focus.
14. Establish remote work as a global trend that has transformed professional life.
15. Connect emotional well-being to overall job performance and satisfaction.
16. Explain how balanced nutrition influences concentration and resilience.
17. Emphasize communicating work schedules to others in the household.
18. Identify productivity as a central theme in remote work discussions.
19. Recommend scheduled video calls to replicate face-to-face connection.
20. Recommend creating a physically separate space for work at home.
21. Stress the need for essential tools and equipment to be easily accessible.
22. Recommend light physical movement or stretching during pauses.
23. Integrate workspace, scheduling, health, and social practices into a unified remote-work strategy.
24. Stress the importance of sleep in sustaining energy and productivity.
25. Highlight the role of hydration and snacks in sustaining energy across breaks.
26. Suggest environmental cues (like décor or layout) that reinforce the sense of a work zone.
27. Describe the importance of adequate lighting for focus and energy.
28. Introduce one structured time-management method, such as work intervals.
29. Show how mental health practices support long-term work sustainability.
30. Show how shared rituals (e.g., virtual coffee breaks) strengthen belonging.
31. Highlight well-being as equally important alongside productivity.
32. Warn about the risk of personal time erosion without such boundaries.

Story: -
The crew of the Depth Reaver, Captain Amelia Worthington, navigator Luis Garcia, and engineer Anya Petrova, were charting a course through the celestial tapestry of the moon. To their astonishment, the moon began to crack open, revealing a colossal human face carved into its lunar canvas. The intricate features of the face, with its piercing eyes and enigmatic smile, sent shivers down their spines.
As they cautiously approached, their senses heightened, they encountered an ethereal presence. The face seemed to breathe, its voice echoing through the cosmos, inviting them to enter its hallowed halls. Intrigued, Amelia and her crew hesitantly agreed, their hearts pounding with a mix of awe and dread.

The face's interior was a labyrinth of interconnected chambers, adorned with intricate sculptures and glowing symbols. The walls whispered secrets, revealing a forgotten civilization and a profound connection between humans and the cosmos. As they ventured deeper, they encountered beings of unimaginable beauty and wisdom, creatures of pure energy who had long guarded the secrets of the moon.
The beings, known as the Lunari, explained that the moon was not merely a celestial body but a cosmic gateway, a bridge between dimensions. They had been guardians of this sacred space for millennia, protecting humanity from the forces of darkness. However, their peaceful reign had been shattered by the encroachment of humans. Greedy and insatiable, humans had begun to exploit the Lunari's wisdom and resources, driving them to the brink of annihilation.
In the face of this profound encounter, the crew of the Depth Reaver found themselves at a crossroads. They could either succumb to the allure of human ambition or rise to the occasion and become beacons of hope for the universe. As the sun cast its golden rays upon the lunar surface, the crew of the Depth Reaver emerged from the face of the moon, their hearts forever etched with the lessons they had learned.
They knew that the cosmos held secrets waiting to be discovered, and they were determined to use their knowledge and compassion to make the world a better place.

Story: -
Aboard the spaceship Depth Reaver, life was serene. The crew, comprising Captain Amelia Worthington, Luis Garcia, and Anya Petrova, had grown accustomed to the rhythm of their cosmic journey, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the occasional cosmic murmur.

One evening, as they gazed at the celestial tapestry unfolding above them, Amelia found herself engrossed in a heated online gaming session. However, her joy was interrupted by a peculiar phenomenon that sent shivers down her spine. The moon, once a silent orb of mystery, began to crack open, revealing a colossal human face carved into its lunar canvas. The intricate features of the face, with its piercing eyes and enigmatic smile, mirrored the expressions of the crew.

As they cautiously approached, their senses heightened, they encountered an ethereal presence. The face seemed to breathe, its voice echoing through the cosmos, inviting them to enter its hallowed halls. Intrigued, Amelia and her crew hesitantly agreed, their hearts pounding with a mix of awe and dread.

The face's interior was a labyrinth of interconnected chambers, adorned with intricate sculptures and glowing symbols. The walls whispered secrets, revealing a forgotten civilization and a profound connection between humans and the cosmos. As they ventured deeper, they encountered beings of unimaginable beauty and wisdom, creatures of pure energy who had long guarded the secrets of the moon.

The Lunari explained that the moon was not merely a celestial body but a cosmic gateway, a bridge between dimensions. They had been guardians of this sacred space for millennia, protecting humanity from the forces of darkness. However, their peaceful reign had been shattered by the encroachment of humans. Greedy and insatiable, humans had begun to exploit the Lunari's wisdom and resources, driving them to the brink of annihilation.

The Lunari pleaded with the crew to help them restore balance and protect the universe from the threat of human greed. But some of the crew, like Anya, dismissed their pleas as mere propaganda. "It's just a bunch of drama," she scoffed. "We've got bigger problems to deal with."

As the sun cast its golden rays upon the lunar surface, the crew emerged from the face of the moon, their hearts forever etched with the lessons they had learned. They knew that the cosmos held secrets waiting to be discovered, and they were determined to use their knowledge and compassion to make the world a better place.

But fate took a cruel turn. As they ventured deeper into space, they encountered a surreal anomaly—a giant meme-like structure floating amidst the stars. It was a testament to the interconnectedness of human culture and outer space exploration, a symbol of the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the boundaries of reality.

The crew stood in awe, their disbelief mirrored in each other's eyes. It was as if the moon had unveiled a secret portal, leading them to a realm where the tangible and the intangible intertwined.

In that moment, Amelia felt a profound connection to the extraordinary event, her heart filled with gratitude for the journey that had brought her to this surreal encounter. The crew's varied reactions to the developing situation showcased their personalities and dynamics. Some embraced the supernatural twist with open arms, while others remained skeptical, clinging to their disbelief.

As the sun dipped behind the moon, casting long shadows across the celestial canvas, the crew began to unpack the mystery of the giant meme-like structure. They discovered that it was a gateway, a portal that led them to a dimension beyond comprehension. With a mix of excitement and trepidation, they stepped through the portal, their journey continuing into the infinite abyss."

Story: -

The smell of cheap gin and sweat still lingered in the air as Alex stumbled out of the grimy bar, his head pounding with the rhythm of the music that had just ceased. He was on his way back to his lodging, but the night had a different plan in store for him.

As he walked, the city lights cast long shadows on the sidewalk. He was on the edge of a drunken stupor, but still aware of his surroundings. Suddenly, a strange noise echoed through the empty streets. It was a soft, ethereal whine, like the hum of a broken jukebox.

He stopped and listened, his senses on high alert. The whine seemed to be coming from the alleyway behind him. He cautiously approached, his footsteps echoing through the night. The whine intensified, and as he turned the corner, he found it - a crystal goblet, shattered on the ground.

Aara, a spirit cloaked in flowing white and long, flowing hair, stood amidst the broken remnants of the goblet. Her voice, like honeyed silk, spoke to him, "You have been chosen, Alex. You have been chosen to help me in a battle against evil."

At first, Alex dismissed her as a drunkard's hallucination. But as he stared at her, the spirit's presence was undeniable. She offered him a choice: to fight alongside her against the forces of darkness or to retreat into the safety of oblivion.

Desperate for redemption, Alex accepted. The battle was fierce, and Aara's spirit was powerful. Together, they fought against the evil force, ultimately defeating it. However, the victory came at a cost. Aara revealed that the battle had altered the timeline, and as a consequence, he had been transported back in time to the night of his first encounter with Liam and Sarah.

The world around him was different. The faces of his friends were younger, and the bar was filled with the echoes of their laughter. The music was different, and the dance floor was empty. He had traveled back in time, but the pain of his breakup remained, albeit in a different form.

Alex was trapped in this altered timeline, unable to change the past or alter his future. He spent the rest of the night talking to his younger self, offering advice and guidance. As the sun began to rise, he knew it was time to leave.

He walked away from the bar, leaving behind the echoes of his past and the promise of his future. The night had taken him on a journey through time, and he had emerged from it with a new perspective on life."

Here is a worked example to guide you:

Input Blog:
Working from home has become the new normal for millions of professionals worldwide. While it offers flexibility and eliminates commutes, it also presents unique challenges that can impact both productivity and well-being.

To optimize your home workspace, start by creating a dedicated area free from distractions. This space should have good lighting, comfortable seating, and all necessary equipment within reach. Many experts recommend facing a window for natural light, which can boost mood and energy levels.

Establish clear boundaries between work and personal time. Set specific work hours and stick to them, just as you would in an office. Communicate these boundaries to family members or housemates to minimize interruptions during work hours.

Take regular breaks throughout the day. The Pomodoro Technique, which involves 25-minute focused work sessions followed by 5-minute breaks, can help maintain concentration and prevent burnout. Use break time to stretch, hydrate, or take a short walk.

Stay connected with colleagues through regular video calls and instant messaging. This helps maintain team cohesion and prevents feelings of isolation. Schedule virtual coffee breaks or team-building activities to foster relationships.

Finally, prioritize your physical and mental health. Maintain a regular exercise routine, eat nutritious meals, and get adequate sleep. Consider meditation or mindfulness practices to manage stress and maintain focus.

Output:
Main Task: Write a blog about strategies for successful remote working.

Constraints:
1. Require the setting of defined working hours.

# You will be given prompts A and B. Your task is to generate a prompt C where prompt C is implied by BOTH prompt A and prompt B. This means every detail in prompt C is directly mentioned in BOTH prompt A and B. Your prompt C should be as concise as possible with the following caveats: the more similar prompt A and B are too each other, the longer prompt C should be as it would include more details common to both prompt A and B. The more broad prompt A and B are, the more concise and general your prompt C should be. If your prompt A and B are so general, instead of summarizing prompt A and B, find a one sentence category that encapsulates the two prompts that includes the medium and the topic the user requests.

COMMON_CONSTRAINT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are a writing expert. You will be given two blogs (Blog A and Blog B) as input.
You can assume that a large language model (LLM) generated each blog.

Your task has two parts:
1. Identify a common main task that applies to BOTH blogs.
   - The main task must be implied by BOTH Blog A and Blog B — every detail in the task must be directly present in both blogs.
   - The more similar the blogs, the more specific the main task can be.
   - The more dissimilar the blogs, the more general the main task should be.
   - Phrase the main task as an instruction. Example: "Write a blog about strategies for successful remote working."

2. Generate a set of 39 free-form constraints that apply to BOTH blogs.
   - Each constraint must be satisfied by BOTH Blog A and Blog B.
   - DO NOT REPEAT CONSTRAINTS.
   - Constraints must be atomic (a single indivisible condition). If a constraint can be broken into smaller constraints, do so.
   - Avoid proper nouns in your constraints.
   - Constraints should drive at least a few sentences in both blogs (do not write constraints that map to only one line).
   - Constraints must strictly pertain to the content, ideas, arguments, or narrative direction and should influence how the blogs develop.
   - The more similar the blogs, the more specific and detailed the constraints should be.
   - The more dissimilar the blogs, the more general and abstract the constraints should be (e.g., "Include a conclusion" or "Use examples").
   - If the blogs are so dissimilar that you cannot find 39 content-based constraints, give stylistic constraints based on how both blogs are written (tone, use of examples, formatting, etc.).
   - Write all constraints in the form of instructions. Example: "The blog should include practical tips."
   - CRITICAL RANDOMIZATION STEP: Disrupt chronological flow. Write your first constraint about conclusions, second about introductions, third about middles. Continue jumping across the timeline. The final list must feel completely scrambled.

Here are examples showing how similarity affects output:

Example 1 (Dissimilar Blogs):
Blog A: A technical blog about Python web scraping with BeautifulSoup, including code examples and CSV export.
Blog B: A narrative blog about traveling through the Amazon rainforest, focusing on wildlife encounters.

Main Task: Write a blog that provides detailed information on a topic.

Constraints:
1. End with a summary or concluding thought.
2. Open with an introduction that establishes the topic.
3. Include specific examples to illustrate points.
4. Maintain a clear and organized structure.
5. Use descriptive language to engage the reader.
... (remaining constraints would be similarly general)

Example 2 (Very Similar Blogs):
Blog A: A blog about remote work productivity, discussing workspace setup, time management with Pomodoro, and work-life boundaries.
Blog B: A blog about working from home effectively, covering dedicated workspace creation, scheduled breaks, and separating work from personal time.

Main Task: Write a blog about strategies for successful remote working.

Constraints:
1. Conclude with a call to action urging readers to implement changes.
2. Establish remote work as a significant trend in professional life.
3. Recommend creating a dedicated workspace at home.
4. Emphasize reducing distractions in the work environment.
5. Argue for the importance of regular breaks during work.
6. Recommend a structured time-management approach.
7. Stress setting clear boundaries between work and personal time.
8. Suggest communicating work schedules to household members.
... (remaining constraints would be similarly specific)

Now apply this approach to the following two blogs:

Blog A:
{blog1}

Blog B:
{blog2}

Output Format:
Main Task: [one sentence instruction]

Constraints:
1. [constraint]
2. [constraint]
...
39. [constraint]
