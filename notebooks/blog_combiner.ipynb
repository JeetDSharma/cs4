    "#    - For example: \"The main task is to write a blog about strategies for successful remote working.\"\n",
    "#    - Phrase the main task as an instruction.\n",

    "#    - DO NOT REPEAT CONSTRAINTS.\n",
    "#    - Constraints must be atomic (a single indivisible condition). If a constraint can be broken into smaller constraints, do so.\n",
    "#    - Avoid proper nouns in your constraints.\n",
    "#    - Constraints should drive at least a few sentences in the blog (do not write constraints that map to only one line).\n",
    "#    - Constraints must strictly pertain to the content, ideas, arguments, or narrative direction of the blog and should influence how the blog develops.\n",
    "#    - If (and only if) you cannot write 39 atomic, content-based constraints, give stylistic constraints based on how the blog is written (tone, use of examples, formatting, etc.).\n",

    "similair_blogs_set1 = [\"\"\"With the start of summer 2020, many businesses have fully transitioned to the \"new normal\" of remote work. Employers and employees alike may have adapted to the shift from physical to virtual offices, but the realities of workplace harassment have not changed. Thus, employers must still comply with their obligations under state and local anti-harassment regulations. Maryland employers should remember the 2018 Disclosing Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Act (the Act), which created a disclosure survey for the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights (the Commission) to collect data on sexual harassment settlements across two reporting cycles. Per the survey, Maryland employers with 50 or more employees must electronically identify: - . If an employer affirmatively answers Question 2, the employer must also answer: \"Whether the employer took personnel action against an employee who was the subject of a settlement.\" The current reporting cycle ends on July 1, 2020. On or before December 15, 2020, the Commission will submit an executive summary of their review of a random selection of surveys, redacting any identifying employer information, to Maryland's Governor, Senate Finance Committee, and House Economic Matters Committee. The Commission will also publish the aggregate number of responses from employers on its website—responses to Question 2 will be retained for public inspection, upon request. Although the Act establishes a mandatory reporting requirement—employers \"shall submit a short survey to the Commission\"—the Act does not establish penalties or enforcement mechanisms for an employer's underreporting or failure to report. Takeaways DWT attorneys are available to help employers comply with state-specific anti-harassment reporting, training, and notice requirements and establish workplaces free from all forms of harassment.\"\"\",\n",

    "\"The company culture needs to built remote work in mind, otherwise it can cause problems when part of the group is not trusted with remote responsibilities, while others are. There are obvious advantages for remote workers: Being able to deeply focus on tasks and problems, skip commuting, read books without distractions, go to gym any time you want, eat and wear what you want. This all can make a huge difference in how you feel and lead your life. But there are definitely problematic things with remote work also. You can get lazy, take a nap or watch a movie during the day. Feeling of loneliness is also very common problem, so it’s quite important to have friends or family nearby. One problem is also trust, which, if you don’t deliver great results, can suddenly go bad since nobody actually sees you do anything. Most issues can be addressed with self-control, healthy habits and proper communication. To build a remote first culture means that there are proper principles in place: - Effective communication guidelines, especially written - Guidelines how to do work, e.g. programming, design, client communication, things to avoid and such - Trust and somewhat clear goals and expectations - Occasional healthy meet-ups or hanging out situations. If people are around the globe, this might be more difficult, but still doable through video chats and yearly meetings The odd thing is that all of the above are very important for non-remote work also. Yet, they are often overlooked when people are busy focusing on non-essential. Remote first culture forces you to focus on the essential.\"]"

    "    \"\"\"As humans, we naturally have a dominant hand. This is the hand that we write with, shake hands, eat with, etc. But sometimes that can extend to other areas, like sports. More specifically, runners can have a dominant side, meaning that some runners have one strong side and one side that’s a bit weaker. MapMyRun’s blog recently wrote an article on the topic. Here’s an excerpt: “If you’re a runner, hopefully you’re already wise to the advantages of doing regular strength workouts. But, while strength training is key for doing well in any activity, there’s a type that’s especially critical for runners: unilateral strength training. According to Lauren Loberg, DPT, board-certified clinical orthopedic specialist with TRIA Orthopaedic, the top benefit of performing unilateral strength exercises — like single-leg squats and deadlifts — is you’re training your body to meet the demands of your sport. After all, running is a single-leg activity, so it only makes sense that you would benefit from moves that shore up your single-leg strength, stability and coordination.” To read the full article, click here!\"\"\",\n",
